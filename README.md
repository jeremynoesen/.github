## About

Default community health files. Certain files in this repo will change things ab
out all of my public repos (such as the funding links).

## Purpose

This allows me to show my funding links on all of my public repos without having
to make a `.gihub` folder in every one. Reduces duplicate files across my GitHub
profile as a whole.
